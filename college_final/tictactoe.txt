Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The game involves two players, typically X and O, who take turns marking spaces in the grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

The game begins with an empty grid, and players take turns making a move by placing their symbol in an empty space. The first player to achieve a row of three of their symbols wins the game. If the grid is filled without either player achieving three in a row, the game is a draw.
